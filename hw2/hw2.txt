Problem 1

  paste your pointer-based shift.c code below:

* Sets the first n indices of array a to the original values of the indices one ahead of it
* Ex: shift([1, 2, 3], 2) would return [2, 3, 3])
*/
void shift(int *a, int n) {
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i != n; i++)
        *(a+i) = *(a+i+1);
}


Problem 2

 #   Line #        Corrected Code 
 -   ------        ---------------
 1.	3	typedef struct point{	
 
 2.	9	int total = 0;		
		// total has to be initialized; if not, then in line #10, 
		// garbage,whatever was in that memory location, will get added to the result.

 3. 	10	total += (*my_node)->var1 + (*my_node)->var2;	     
		// Because a pointer to a pointer is passed to the function. 
		// point **my_node is a pointer to pointer of type point	
	
 4. 	15	struct point *arr[5];	
		// has to be of the structure type to be able to point to it.

 5. 	16	struct point pt1 = {.var1 = 1, .var2 = 2};	
		// This is the right way of initialization

 6.  	17	arr[0] = &pt1;		
		// Because it is an array of pointers. we have to assign
		// its (pt1's) address to arr[0].
